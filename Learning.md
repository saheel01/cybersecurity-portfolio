## üîç Notes:
- This is foundational knowledge for all Blue Team roles
- I‚Äôll need this later for firewall rules, log analysis, and alerts
### What i did?
- Till day 2 i have installed dual boot with ubuntu and windows 11
- Leaned Linux Commands some basic
- I Practiced:
- pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, echo, nano, rm, rmdir, cat
- Created/deleted folders and files from terminal
- OSI Model (7 Layers)
- IP Addressing & Ports
- CIA Triad:
  end till day 2

## Day 3 ‚Äì TryHackMe + Python Mini-Script

### TryHackMe Progress:
- Started the "Complete Beginner" path
- Completed: Introduction to Cyber Security (3+ modules)

### Python Mini Project:
- Created a script `analyze_logs.py` to scan logs for failed entries
- Sample log entries stored in `sample_logs.txt`
- Useful for SOC-style log triage and filtering

### Reflection:
- Now seeing how scripts help automate boring detection tasks
- TryHackMe is giving hands-on experience without needing local tools yet

## Day 4 ‚Äì Log Analysis + TryHackMe Linux

### ‚úÖ Python Script:
- Created `log_parser.py` to detect failed login attempts
- Used file reading, loops, and regex matching
- Sample file: `sample_auth.log`

### ‚úÖ Python Concepts Learned:
- Functions
- Regex filtering
- Reusable detection logic

### ‚úÖ TryHackMe Progress:
- Started "Linux Fundamentals Part 1"
- Learned Linux file structure and key commands (`ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, `ps`, etc.)

### üîç Reflection:
- Real logs are messy but fun to analyze
- Python makes repetitive tasks way easier
- Linux knowledge will help a lot in incident response
