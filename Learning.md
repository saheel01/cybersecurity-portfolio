## Day 3 ‚Äì TryHackMe + Python Mini-Script

### TryHackMe Progress:
- Started the "Complete Beginner" path
- Completed: Introduction to Cyber Security (3+ modules)

### Python Mini Project:
- Created a script `analyze_logs.py` to scan logs for failed entries
- Sample log entries stored in `sample_logs.txt`
- Useful for SOC-style log triage and filtering

### Reflection:
- Now seeing how scripts help automate boring detection tasks
- TryHackMe is giving hands-on experience without needing local tools yet
